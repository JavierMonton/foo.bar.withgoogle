# foo.bar.withgoogle
This is a repository of the solutions that I did for [foo.bar Challenge](https://foobar.withgoogle.com/) from Google

It seems to be a way that Google has to hire some people but I'm not sure about that, 
I took it as a game, pretty similar to HackerRank contexts.

# How it starts

I was searching something simple about Python in Google (I'm not a Python expert, 
I prefer statically typed languages and I usually work with [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/))
when suddenly the results page of Google did an animation and showed a message saying:
"Curious developers are known to seek interesting problems. Solve one for Google"

![foobar start message](start.png "Foobar start Message")

I was really surprised about that I with no doubt, I clicked "yes".

Then a new website appears, it seems like a computer console so I started to try commands like `ls` and `help`.
I found a list of commands and a few explanations. `request` command gives you a new code challenge.

# Levels

There are 5 levels, and different number of problems per level. These are the solutions that I developed.
I'm posting this as a curiosity and a small help to others, as I consider this a game more than a hiring process. 
I encourage others to take ideas, or to use the code to test new scenarios , but not to copy&paste the code as solution

# Progress
`status` command gives a visualization of the completed levels

# Finishing
After level 3, the platform asks you for your personal contact (email, phone, etc) 
and says that a recruiter from Google may reach you

After level 5 a small animation an a encrypted message says you "congratulations"
